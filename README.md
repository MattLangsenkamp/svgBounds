# SVGBounds
The purpose of this library is to provide functionality needed to parse SVG paths, transform SVG paths, and compute the bounding box of SVG paths.

Much of this work has been derived straight from the [SVG path spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html) and the [SVG transform spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/coords.html) 

This library is geared towards extracting bounding box information from SVGs and does not implement all the functionality within the full SVG spec.
